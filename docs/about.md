# About

My name is Lucian, and I've been a frontend engineer for three years. However, I don't want to limit myself to just frontend engineering. I'm interested in exploring other technologies, like cloud computing and AI. I enjoy thinking about what software or investments can help me progress and find intriguing.

I created this blog to record what I'm learning and what I read. It helps me remember the interesting things I've done, and if I ever encounter the same problem again, I can return here to find the solution.

Recently, I've been learning English and focusing on fitness. These two activities have changed me significantly. I have more energy now, and I can speak a little English with foreigners. This has also made it faster for me to learn skills from English documents.
